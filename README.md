# Neupool

Investment Pool for NeuFund ETOs and other commitments

This smart contract allows aggregation of retail investments when (due to technical reasons) it is impossible to invest in small batches. It accumulates small retail investments unless the total size reaches minimum allowed investment. On the Neufund ecosystem side it acts as a single investor. Once minimum required batch size is reached, the investment is sent to Neufund and accumulation starts over.
